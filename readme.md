#	The OSHB Hebrew Lexicon

The Hebrew Lexicon is now established in its current format.  It is
comprised of three separate files:

1.	BrownDriverBriggs.xml contains the current BDB content.  It remains
	a work in progress.  Entries will be filled out over time, especially
	in the area of completing the scripture references, and Hebrew words.

2.	HebrewStrong.xml contains the content for Strong's Hebrew Dictionary.
	Numerous corrections have been made, since the initial offering, in a
	significantly different form.  The layout now follows the Hebrew Mesh,
	with duplicated entries recombined.

3.	LexicalIndex.xml is now the meeting place of BDB, Strong and the
	TWOT numbers, again significantly improved from the original Strong's
	Dictionary, and incorporating corrections that have arisen in the
	process of constructing the new lexicon.

The lexical index is meant to bridge the gap between the accessibility
and ubiquity of Strong's Dictionary, and the comprehensiveness and
accuracy of BDB.  For those versed in Hebrew, and wanting the depth of
BDB, it can now be accessed on its own terms.  For those more familiar
with Strong numbers, or having current applications based on them, the
lexical index provides access directly to entries via the Strong numbers.

Additional files for the current iteration of the lexicon include:

1.	AugIndex.xml to map the augmented Strong numbers of the OSHB to the IDs
	of the lexical index.

2.	BdbSchema.xsd the XML schema for BrownDriverBriggs.xml.

3.	LiSchema.xsd the XML schema for LexicalIndex.xml.

4.	StrongSchema.xsd the XML schema for HebrewStrong.xml.

5.	HebrewLexicon.pdf documentation for all parts of the lexicon.

6.	index.html and its HomeFiles directory have been added to provide a
	a home page for the lexicon project.

TWOT numbers are included for reference purposes only.  We are in no way
directly transcribing the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament.

Thanks to Daniel Owens, for much help, especially in transcribing the
main entries, not listed in Strong's.
